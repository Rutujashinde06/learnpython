		    The absence of electrical resistance exhibited by superconducting materials would have enormous potential 
			for applications if it existed at ambient temperature and pressure conditions. Despite decades of intense 
			research efforts, such a state has yet to be realized1,2. At ambient pressures, cuprates are the material
			class exhibiting superconductivity to the highest critical superconducting transition temperatures (Tc),
			up to about 133 K (refs. 3,4,5).
			 These include temperature-dependent resistance with and without an applied magnetic field, the magnetization 
			 (M) versus magnetic field (H) curve, a.c. and d.c. magnetic susceptibility, as well as heat-capacity measurements.
			 X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and theoretical simulations provide some insight into the 
			 stoichiometry of the synthesized material. Nevertheless, further experiments and simulations are needed to 
			 determine the exact stoichiometry of hydrogen and nitrogen, and their respective atomistic positions, in a greater
			 effort to further understand the superconducting state of the material.
